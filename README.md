# wheat_platform1.0
This is  a high-throughput phenotyping platform to characterize wheat spike morphology. Based on this softwareï¼ŒWe can measure spike thickness (the width of the spike side), width (the width of the front of the spike), area, and volume for five equal parts with the same relative length.

##Software Installation
1. Install the wheat phenotyping tool by executing wheat_installer_1.1.2.exe.

2. Extract the contents of Debug1.0.rar and overwrite all files in the installation directory.
   Note: The installer requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable as a prerequisite.

##Implementation Details
Full methodological descriptions appear in our article:
"Geographical differentiation, breeding selection and molecular design for wheat spike morphology" [Citation].
